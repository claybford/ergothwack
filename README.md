This repository is for hardware development of the ergoTHWACK wireless mechanical split keyboard, designed by Clayton Ford.

The ergoTHWACK is a custom design, inspired by the ErgoDash by omkbd and the Corne GLP by beekeeb, that:
- requires no layer usage or memorization for general use
- has a 2U spacebar that is comfortably under the thumb for typing and gaming
- includes a Cirque Glidepoint 35mm trackpad and a rotary encoder for full mouse functionality without moving the right hand off the keyboard
- has an integrated wrist pad and tenting for ergonomics
- and uses Gateron KS-33 low-profile switches for more similarity in typing to non-mechanical keyboards.

In addition it has: 
- 2 more rotary encoders on the left
- RGB backlit keys and underglow
- tactile swiches for reset and settings control
- LED power shutoff switches
- and a 10000mAh battery on each side for plenty of wireless bluetooth backlit runtime.

A longer write-up on the design rationale is here: https://www.claytonbford.com/portfolio/ergothwack

The ergoTHWACK uses the ZMK firmware and the nice!nano. For more information about each, please visit https://zmk.dev/ and https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/ respectively.

Shield support for ZMK for the ergoTHWACK is here: https://github.com/claybford/ergothwack-shield-module

The ergoTHWACK uses a fork of ZMK to support all of its features, which its shield support repo uses and links to for building. It's directly available here: https://github.com/claybford/zmk

The ergoTHWACK keyboard is in beta, and there are several known issues with the design. Once a version is ready for others to try to build, a guide to do so will be made available!
